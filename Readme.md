## ESP32 and ESP8266 wifi weather station

This is a Weather Station project made by [VolosR](https://github.com/VolosR/TTGOWeatherStation) that loads and displays weather forecasts for given location.

I changed the structure of the project to be run as Platformio project, because
- I want to run is on both esp8266 and esp32
- I want to run it with multiple screen options (240x240 and 320x240)
 
### Why

I'm working on my own development boards for both listed MCUs and this project is a good demonstration of kind of projects they would happily support
